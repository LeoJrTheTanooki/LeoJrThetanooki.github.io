        >Welcome to my corner of the internet =]<br /><br />So I finally got
        around to updating my website after neglecting it for so long, I suppose
        obligaton is a good motivation in some cases. And oh wow, what an
        overhaul it is, this thing used to just be a list of art and now it has
        pages and junk. There's certainly more I wish to do here, and hopefully
        the higher powers of CSS will be kind to me. Will it be hell to work
        with? Maybe, but at least I can see the changes instantly... for now at
        least, and hoo boy do I feel like Javascript will throw a wrench at
        things when I get to it. Regardless I hope to really spruce up this site
        because I can't live like this forever... there isn't enough video game
        references!</m2
