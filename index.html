                  Hoo boy... trying to make this box here look the way it does
                  while staying consistent was not easy at all... but it was
                  absolutely worth it, I have no regrets. So yeah, another
                  overhaul here, this time the dialogue boxes are much closer to
                  EarthBound, down to the colors chosen. I also grabbed the
                  Apple Kid font one of my friends used on their website to use
                  on here, although I noticed no bullet point glyphs were on the
                  font itself, so I went out of my way to add my own so I can
                  use it myself, while trying to stay as accurate as possible to
                  the games. I know there will be people out there who want to
                  know how to do this, so I made a page dedicated to how you too
                  can make your own EarthBound dialogue boxes, either with HTML
                  alone or by using CSS classes. I've been watching One Piece as
                  well, finished the East Blue arc, and I've come to the
                  absolute conclusion that Luffy is definitely on the spectrum,
                  there's no doubt about that. Anyhow, this won't be the last
                  time this page recieves an overhaul either, I'm going to keep
                  at this website with what I've learned, even if it kills me!
                  (TRANSLATION: even if it's tedious and time consuming as
                  hell!) Background should also be less eyestraining, I was told
                  I should do that for the sake of others.
