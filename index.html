                  Woe, dropdowns be upon ye. New year, new opportunities to do
                  dumb crap... is what I would say if I updated this a month
                  ago, my god an update was long overdue... actually scratch
                  that, an entirely new site from sratch is overdue, I can't
                  work like this anymore, there's too much that I learned at
                  this point, this site has charm but is also severely lacking.
                  But I won't wipe the site completely, and I won't leave it
                  completely abandoned. I'll update the site some more until I'm
                  able to make a brand new one. Too tired to decorate portfolio
                  page now, will do at some other point.

                    Hoo boy... trying to make this box here look the way it does
                    while staying consistent was not easy at all... but it was
                    absolutely worth it, I have no regrets. So yeah, another
                    overhaul here, this time the dialogue boxes are much closer
                    to EarthBound, down to the colors chosen. I also grabbed the
                    Apple Kid font one of my friends used on their website to
                    use on here, although I noticed no bullet point glyphs were
                    on the font itself, so I went out of my way to add my own so
                    I can use it myself, while trying to stay as accurate as
                    possible to the games. I know there will be people out there
                    who want to know how to do this, so I made a page dedicated
                    to how you too can make your own EarthBound dialogue boxes,
                    either with HTML alone or by using CSS classes. I've been
                    watching One Piece as well, finished the East Blue arc, and
                    I've come to the absolute conclusion that Luffy is
                    definitely on the spectrum, there's no doubt about that.
                    Anyhow, this won't be the last time this page recieves an
                    overhaul either, I'm going to keep at this website with what
                    I've learned, even if it kills me! (TRANSLATION: even if
                    it's tedious and time consuming ascollapseExample hell!)
                    Background should also be less eyestraining, I was told I
                    should do that for the sake of others.

                    I need to find a way to better journal this, I commented my
                    previous update text out, but I also don't want to trash it
                    completely either, plus I want others to be able to read it.
                    I'll find a way, but for now I should mention that I'll be
                    updating this website a bit more regularly for smaller
                    things. I also feel like I should make a blog page to put my
                    previous update text. Anyhow, school's going fine, I'm still
                    enjoying One Piece, and overall things are fairly stable.
                    Hell, I feel more awake now ever since I've started getting
                    into this whole coding school thing. Feel free to look
                    around, not much was added compared to the previous version
                    though.
                    <br />
                    ...Y'know I really should work on the alt text for this
                    site's images, and I should really learn how to make that
                    alt text good.
